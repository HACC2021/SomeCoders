# SomeCoders

At this point, I can't figure out how to make a PR to update code to the main branch,as it is giving an error related to unrelated commit histories. I am still trying to resolve this issue. As a result, all my code is still on the branch titled "master". Please switch to that branch (https://github.com/HACC2021/SomeCoders/tree/master) to conduct the technical review. Thank you.
