Web application to solve the challenge of notifying pet owners that their animal is ready to be picked up from the quarantine center. This web application was developed using C#/ASP.NET web framework. The user is able to interact with the MSSQL database of pet owners and is able to send notifications to their phone numbers.

The database for this application requires user authentication to access. I have created an account for the technical reviwer of this project. In order to access the database for this application, please use the following login credentials:
